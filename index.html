        <p>Hi! I'm Dylan Luttrell. I love to play video games and watch YouTube and anime! Currently I'm a second year
            enrolled at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology as a Computer Science major and I plan on getting a second
            major in Data Science and potentially a minor in math.</p>

        <p>This site is a sample portfolio project that I'm making for my Sophmore Web Programming Class (CSSE 280).
            It's supposed to us how to make our own portfolio websites and how to give them some pizzaz and personality.
        </p>

        <p>You can check out the Portfolio page to see some of my other projects in the past. Or check out the Resume
            page to see my resume and the acomplishments I have listed on there!</p>
